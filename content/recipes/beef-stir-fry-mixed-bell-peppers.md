## Ingredients

- 2 tbsp sesame oil
- 1 kg beef fillet, thinly sliced
- 2 garlic cloves, minced
- 2 tbsp fresh ginger, grated
- 1 red bell pepper, sliced
- 1 green bell pepper, sliced
- 1 orange bell pepper, sliced
- 1 yellow bell pepper, sliced
- 2 large onions, sliced
- Freshly ground black pepper, to taste
- Toasted sesame seeds, for garnish
- 1/2 cup soy sauce
- 1/3 cup oyster sauce
- 1 tbsp cornstarch
- 1/3 cup water
- 1 tbsp honey

## Instructions

1. Heat sesame oil in a large pan or wok over high heat.
2. Add the sliced beef and stir-fry until browned and cooked through. Remove and set aside.
3. Add a touch more sesame oil if needed. Sauté garlic, ginger, and sliced onion for 1–2 minutes until fragrant.
4. Add the bell peppers and stir-fry for 3–4 minutes until just tender but still crisp.
5. In a bowl mix soy sauce, oyster sauce, cornstarch, water, and honey until smooth.
6. Return the beef to the pan with the vegetables. Pour in the sauce and stir well.
7. Cook over medium-high heat for 2–3 minutes until the sauce thickens and coats the beef and vegetables.
8. Garnish with toasted sesame seeds and a few cracks of black pepper. Serve over steamed basmati rice.
