## Ingredients

- 10 to 12 small Lebanese zucchinis
- Sea salt & black pepper
- 1 medium can of tomato sauce
- 1 cup water
- 100g short-grain rice
- 250g minced lamb or beef

## Instructions

1. Cut off the zucchini stalks. Using a vegetable corer, carefully hollow out the zucchinis from the stalk end, being careful not to pierce the bottoms
2. Wash the hollowed zucchinis thoroughly and set aside to drain
3. In a bowl, combine the rice and minced meat. Season with salt and pepper and mix well
4. Fill each zucchini with the rice and meat mixture, leaving about 1 cm of space at the top to allow for expansion as the rice cooks
5. Place the stuffed zucchinis vertically (stem side up) in a large pot. Add the tomato sauce, water, 1 teaspoon of salt, and ½ tsp of black pepper. Bring to a boil over medium heat
6. Reduce the heat to low and simmer gently for about 50min or until the zucchinis are tender and the sauce has thickened
