## Ingredients

- 1 cup frozen peas, thawed
- 1 cup fresh ricotta
- 2 eggs
- 1/4 cup cooked quinoa
- A bunch of fresh mint leaves, chopped
- Sea salt, to taste
- Cracked black pepper, to taste
- Extra virgin olive oil
- Grated lemon rind (for garnish and yogurt sauce)
- 1 cup Greek yogurt

## Instructions

1. In a large mixing bowl combine peas, chopped mint, ricotta, eggs, quinoa, sea salt, and cracked black pepper. Stir until well mixed.
2. Using a spoon or cookie scoop, form the mixture into 8 equal balls. Gently flatten into small patties and lightly brush both sides with olive oil.
