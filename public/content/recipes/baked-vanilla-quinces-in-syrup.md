## Ingredients

- 4 quinces, peeled and halved
- 3 cups water
- 3 cups cane sugar
- Lemon rinds (from 1–2 lemons)
- 2 tbsp lemon juice
- 1 vanilla bean (or 1–2 tsp vanilla extract)

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 200°C.  
2. Arrange the quince halves, cut side up, in a baking dish.  
3. In a saucepan, combine water, sugar, lemon rinds, lemon juice, and the vanilla bean (split and scraped) or vanilla extract. Bring to a simmer, stirring until the sugar dissolves.  
4. Pour the hot syrup over the quinces, ensuring they are mostly submerged. Cover the dish tightly with foil.  
5. Bake for 1 hour. Remove the foil, turn the quinces, and continue baking for another 45–60 minutes, or until the quinces are very soft and deep in color.  
6. Let cool slightly in the syrup. Serve warm or chilled, spooning plenty of syrup over the top.  
7. Optional: serve with vanilla ice cream, clotted cream, or ashta.
