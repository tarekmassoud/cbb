## Ingredients

- 4 white fish fillets  
- 1 cup cherry tomatoes, halved

- 2 tbsp capers, drained  
- 2 tbsp white wine vinegar  
- Zest of 1 lemon

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 190°C.  
2. In a bowl, mix the cherry tomatoes, olives, garlic olive oil, white wine vinegar, and lemon zest to make the olive-tomato relish.  
3. Lay lemon slices in the bottom of a baking dish and place the fish fillets on top.  
4. Drizzle the fish with some garlic olive oil and sprinkle with chili flakes, cracked black pepper, and salt flakes.  
5. Spoon the olive-tomato relish over and around the fish fillets, then scatter the za’atar leaves on top.
