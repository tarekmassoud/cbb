## Ingredients
### Cake
- 1½ cups (240g) buckwheat flour
- 1 cup (160g) coconut sugar or brown sugar
- 1 tsp baking powder
- ½ tsp bicarbonate of soda
- 2 tsp ground cinnamon
- 1 cup (260g) mashed ripe banana
- 1 egg
- ½ cup (140g) thick Greek-style yogurt
- ⅓ cup (80ml) grapeseed or neutral oil
- 2 tsp vanilla bean paste or vanilla extract
- 2 bananas, thinly sliced, for topping

### Vanilla Syrup
- 1 cup water
- 1 cup sugar
- 1 vanilla bean, split and seeds scraped
- 2 tbsp apple or tuffah syrup, plus extra for brushing

## Instructions
- Preheat oven to 160°C. Line a 20×30 cm tin with baking paper.
- In a large bowl, whisk flour, sugar, baking powder, bicarb, and cinnamon. Add banana, egg, yogurt, oil, and vanilla; mix to combine.
- Pour into the tin and top with banana slices.
- Bake 45 minutes or until a skewer comes out clean. Cool 5 minutes in the tin.

### Make the syrup
- In a small pan, combine water, sugar, vanilla bean and seeds. Simmer 6–8 minutes to thicken slightly, then stir in apple syrup; remove the bean.

### Finish
- Brush half the hot syrup over the warm cake. Serve warm or cooled with remaining syrup.
