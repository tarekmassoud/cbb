## Ingredients

- 2 large bananas (or 5 small), for the top
- 1/3 cup maple syrup, plus extra for drizzling
- 3 small bananas, mashed
- 1/4 cup milk
- 1/3 cup extra virgin olive oil
- 3 eggs, lightly beaten
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 2 tsp ground cinnamon
- 1 cup spelt flour
- 3 tsp baking powder
- 1 cup almond meal (ground almonds)

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 160°C. Lightly grease a 20 cm round cake tin and line the base with non-stick baking paper.  
2. Pour 1/3 cup maple syrup into the base of the tin and swirl to coat evenly.  
3. Peel and cut the bananas for the top into thick slices. Arrange them in a single layer over the maple syrup.  
4. In a large bowl, whisk together the mashed bananas, milk, olive oil, eggs, vanilla, and cinnamon until smooth.  
5. Add the spelt flour, baking powder, and almond meal; mix gently until just combined. Do not overmix.  
6. Pour the batter over the bananas in the prepared tin and smooth the surface.  
7. Bake for 55 minutes or until a skewer inserted into the center comes out clean.  
8. Allow the cake to cool in the tin for 15 minutes, then invert onto a serving plate.  
9. Drizzle with extra maple syrup before serving warm or at room temperature.
