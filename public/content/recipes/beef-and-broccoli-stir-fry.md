## Ingredients

### For the Beef + Marinade
- 1 lb steak, thinly sliced  
- 1 tbsp oyster sauce  
- 1 tbsp soy sauce  
- 1/2 tsp cornstarch  
- 1/4 tsp kosher salt  
- 1/4 tsp black pepper  
- 1 tsp rice wine or vinegar  

### For the Sauce
- 1/2 cup water  
- 1 tbsp cornstarch  
- 1 tbsp soy sauce  
- 1 tbsp oyster sauce  
- 1 tbsp rice vinegar  
- 2 tsp sugar  
- 1/4 tsp black pepper  

### For the Stir-Fry
- 5 cups broccoli florets, bite-sized  
- 2 tbsp avocado oil, divided  
- 3 tbsp fresh ginger, minced  
- 4 cloves garlic, minced  
- 3 scallions, sliced  
- 1 tsp rice vinegar  
- Cooked white rice, for serving

## Method
1. In a bowl, combine steak with oyster sauce, soy, cornstarch, salt, pepper, and rice wine. Mix well; refrigerate 20–30 minutes.  
2. Whisk sauce ingredients: water, cornstarch, soy, oyster sauce, rice vinegar, sugar, pepper. Set aside.  
3. Bring a pot of salted water to a boil. Add broccoli; blanch 1 minute. Drain and set aside.  
4. Heat 1 tbsp oil in a wok or large skillet over medium-high. Add marinated beef in a single layer; sear 2 minutes until browned. Stir-fry 1–2 minutes more. Remove.  
5. Reduce heat if needed. Add remaining oil, ginger, and garlic; stir 30 seconds. Add broccoli; stir-fry 2–3 minutes until tender-crisp.  
6. Return beef to pan. Stir sauce; pour in. Toss until thick, about 1 minute. Add scallions and a splash of rice vinegar. Toss. Serve over rice.
