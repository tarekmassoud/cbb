## Ingredients

- 3 large eggs  
- ¾ cup heavy cream  
- 1 cup milk  
- 1 tbsp sugar (optional, for slight sweetness in the custard)  
- 1 tsp vanilla extract and seeds from 1 vanilla pod (optional)  
- Pinch of salt  
- 4–6 thick slices brioche  
- 2 tbsp butter  
- Toppings: fresh berries (strawberries, blueberries, raspberries) and honey  

## Instructions

1. In a shallow bowl, whisk together the eggs, cream, milk, sugar (if using), vanilla, and a pinch of salt until smooth.  
2. Dip each slice of brioche into the custard mixture for 10–15 seconds per side, letting it absorb the liquid without getting too soggy.  
3. Heat a skillet over medium heat and add the butter (or a little oil).  
4. Place the soaked bread slices in the pan and cook 2–3 minutes per side, until golden brown and slightly crispy on the edges.  
5. Transfer to a serving plate, top with fresh berries, and drizzle generously with honey.  
6. Serve immediately while warm.
