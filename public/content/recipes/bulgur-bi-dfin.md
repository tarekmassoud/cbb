## Ingredients
- 1/2 lb lamb mawzet  
- 2 to 3 lamb bones (optional)  
- 1½ cups cooked chickpeas  
- 2 medium onions, finely diced  
- 8 cloves garlic, minced  
- 2 cups bulgur (4 cups broth)  
- 1/8 tsp Lebanese 7-spices  
- 1/8 tsp black pepper  
- 2 tsp ground cinnamon  
- 4 tbsp olive oil  
- Salt, to taste

## Instructions
1. In a large uncovered pressure cooker, brown the lamb mawzet and bones (if using) for about 10 minutes. Add a cinnamon stick, celery, bay leaves, one onion, and cover with water. Cook under pressure for 30–40 minutes.  
2. In a separate pan, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add the diced onion and sauté until translucent. Stir in the minced garlic, bulgur, spices, and salt. Cook for a few minutes until the bulgur is coated.  
3. Add the cooked chickpeas, cooked meat, and some of the broth from the pressure cooker. Stir to combine.  
4. Cover and simmer until the chickpeas and bulgur are tender, about 10–15 minutes.  
5. Turn off the heat, cover with a kitchen cloth, and place the lid back on for 10 minutes to allow the flavors to meld. Serve hot with laban.
