## Ingredients
- Stems from a bunch of chard (about 2–3 tbsp tahini needed)  
- Tahini (about 2–3 tbsp)  
- Water (to loosen)  
- Lemon juice (freshly squeezed, about 2–3 tbsp)  
- Salt (to taste)  
- Garlic (2 cloves, minced)  
- Parsley (a handful, finely chopped)  
- Olive oil (about 2 tbsp)

## Method
1. After using the chard leaves, take the stems and cut them to equal lengths.  
2. Bring a pot of water to a boil. Add kosher salt and the chard stems; cook for 10 minutes or until tender. Drain well.  
3. In a mixing bowl, combine tahini, lemon juice, and salt. Stir until the mixture becomes smooth; add water to loosen if needed.  
4. Add the cooked stems and toss with the tahini sauce.  
5. Sprinkle with finely chopped parsley and a tablespoon of olive oil. Enjoy.
