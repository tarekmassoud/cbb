## Ingredients
- 1.5 kg whole chicken, boiled and cooled in warm water  
- 200g mozzarella and Gruyère cheese, shredded  
- 4 large portobello mushrooms, sliced  
- 2 tbsp olive oil or butter  
- 2 cloves garlic, minced  
- Salt and pepper, to taste  

### For the béchamel sauce
- 4 tbsp unsalted butter  
- 6 tbsp all-purpose flour  
- 5 cups whole milk (warm)  
- 6 cups chicken stock (from the boiled chicken)  
- 1/4 tsp ground nutmeg  
- Salt and pepper, to taste  
- 1/4 cup grated Parmesan (optional)  

### For the pasta
- 400g tagliatelle noodles  
- Salt for pasta water  

## Instructions
1. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the tagliatelle and cook until al dente.  
2. Heat olive oil or butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the sliced mushrooms and sauté until golden and they release moisture, about 5 minutes. Add minced garlic and sauté 1 minute more. Season with salt and pepper.  
3. In a medium saucepan, melt butter over medium heat. Whisk in flour and cook 1–2 minutes to form a roux. Gradually add warm milk and chicken stock, whisking constantly to avoid lumps. Simmer until thickened, 4–5 minutes. Stir in nutmeg, salt, pepper, and Parmesan if using.  
4. Preheat oven to 180°C. In a greased baking dish, layer half the cooked tagliatelle. Top with shredded chicken and sautéed mushrooms. Pour half the béchamel over the mixture. Add remaining tagliatelle on top, then the rest of the béchamel.  
5. Sprinkle mozzarella and Gruyère evenly over the top. Bake 30 minutes, or until cheese is golden and bubbling. Rest 5 minutes before serving.
