## Ingredients

- 150g unsalted butter, chopped
- 1/4 cup apple syrup
- 50g dark chocolate, finely chopped
- 1kg bananas (about 6), peeled and halved lengthways
- 1 sheet butter puff pastry, thawed
- 1/4 cup hazelnuts, roughly chopped, toasted
- Vanilla ice cream, to serve

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 200°C. Place a 21cm heavy, ovenproof skillet on high heat.
2. Add butter and apple syrup; bring to a simmer and cook for 30 seconds.
3. Remove from heat and stir in the dark chocolate until smooth.
4. Arrange the banana halves, cut-side down and slightly overlapping, over the chocolate mixture.
5. Lay the puff pastry over the bananas and gently press to secure; make 3 small slits in the centre to vent.
6. Set the pan on an oven tray and bake for 30–35 minutes, until the pastry is dark golden.
7. Cool in the pan for 2 minutes, then invert onto a serving plate.
8. Top with toasted hazelnuts and serve warm with vanilla ice cream.
