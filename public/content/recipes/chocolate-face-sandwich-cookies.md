## Ingredients

- 250 g butter, softened
- 165 g icing sugar
- 1 tbsp vanilla extract
- 1 egg yolk
- 335 g all-purpose flour
- 220 g chocolate spread
- Extra icing sugar, for dusting

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 180°C. Line baking trays with non-stick baking paper.  
2. In the bowl of a stand mixer or with a hand mixer, beat the butter and icing sugar until pale and creamy.  
3. Add the vanilla and egg yolk and beat until well combined.  
4. Add the flour and mix on low speed until a smooth dough forms.  
5. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and chill in the fridge for 15 minutes or until firm enough to roll.  
6. On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough to about 5 mm thickness.  
7. Use cookie cutters to cut rounds from the dough. For half of the cookies, use a small sharp knife or cutter to cut out “eyes” and “mouths” to make faces.  
8. Place all cookies on the prepared trays and bake for 10–12 minutes, or until lightly golden around the edges. Cool completely on wire racks.  
9. Spread the plain cookies with chocolate spread and top with the “face” cookies to form sandwiches.  
10. Dust with icing sugar before serving.
