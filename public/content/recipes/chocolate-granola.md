## Ingredients
- 3 cups rolled oats  
- 3 cups chopped raw nuts (almonds, cashews, etc.)  
- 1 cup unsweetened shredded coconut  
- 1/2 cup cocoa powder  
- 1/2 tsp salt  
- 1/3 cup maple syrup  
- 1/4 cup + 2 tbsp melted coconut oil  
- 2 tsp vanilla extract  
- 1 tablet of your favorite chocolate, finely chopped

## Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 160°C. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper.  
2. In a large bowl, combine oats, chopped nuts, coconut, cocoa powder, and salt. Mix.  
3. Add maple syrup, melted coconut oil, and vanilla; stir to combine.  
4. Spread across the baking sheet in an even layer. Bake 30 minutes, tossing halfway.  
5. Remove and let cool completely on the baking sheet—the granola will firm up as it cools.  
6. Once cool, add chopped chocolate and stir together. Store in a sealed container.
