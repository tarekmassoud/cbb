## Ingredients

- 150 g flour, sifted  
- 250 ml milk  
- 250 ml cream  
- 4 eggs  
- Pinch of salt  
- Butter or oil, for frying  

## Instructions

1. In a mixing bowl, combine the sifted flour and a pinch of salt.  
2. Make a well in the center and crack in the eggs.  
3. Gradually pour in the milk and cream while whisking continuously until you have a smooth, thin batter.  
4. Let the batter rest for 15–30 minutes to thicken slightly.  
5. Heat a non-stick frying pan over medium heat and add a small amount of butter or oil.  
6. Pour a ladleful of batter into the pan, tilting and swirling to spread it into a thin, even layer.  
7. Cook for 1–2 minutes until the edges start to lift and the bottom is golden, then flip and cook the other side for 1 minute.  
8. Repeat with the remaining batter, oiling the pan as needed.  
9. Serve warm with your favorite toppings or fillings.
