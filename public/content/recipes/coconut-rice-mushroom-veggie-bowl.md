## Ingredients

### Rice & Veggies
- 1 cup basmati rice
- 1 cup coconut milk
- 1 cup water
- 2 tbsp toasted sesame seeds
- 2 tbsp coconut oil
- 500 g brown mushrooms, sliced
- 4 heads pak choy (or broccoli), chopped
- 4 handfuls unshelled edamame beans
- 4 spring onions, chopped
- Fresh coriander leaves
- 1 red chili, sliced

### Dressing
- 4 tbsp hoisin sauce
- 2 tsp fresh chili, chopped
- 2 tsp fresh ginger, grated
- 2 tsp honey
- 2 tbsp sesame oil
- 2 tbsp tamari sauce
- 5 tbsp white rice vinegar

## Instructions

1. Rinse the rice, then place in a saucepan with coconut milk and water. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, cover, and cook until the rice is fluffy and the liquid is absorbed. Fluff with a fork.  
2. In a large pan, heat the coconut oil over medium-high heat. Add the mushrooms and cook until they release their juices and turn golden.  
3. Add pak choy and edamame; cook for about 5 minutes, stirring often, until just tender.  
4. In a small bowl, whisk together hoisin sauce, chopped chili, ginger, honey, sesame oil, tamari, and rice vinegar until smooth.  
5. To serve, spoon coconut rice into bowls. Top with mushrooms, pak choy, edamame, spring onions, coriander leaves, and sliced red chili.  
6. Drizzle with the hoisin dressing, sprinkle with toasted sesame seeds, and serve immediately.
