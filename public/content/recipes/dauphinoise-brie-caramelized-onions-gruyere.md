## Ingredients
- 1.8–2 kg potatoes, thinly sliced  
- 2 large yellow onions, thinly sliced  
- 45 g salted butter  
- 5 garlic cloves, roughly chopped  
- 1 1/2 cups heavy cream  
- 2 tsp kosher salt (plus more for boiling potatoes)  
- 1 tsp freshly cracked pepper  
- 2 tsp fresh thyme leaves  
- 2 cups Gruyère cheese, shredded  
- 2–3 cold brie rounds, cut in half horizontally

## Instructions
1. Peel and thinly slice onions (mandoline helps). Melt butter over medium heat; add onions, salt, and pepper. Cook 10 minutes; reduce heat and continue to caramelize 40–50 minutes until deeply golden. Add garlic; sauté 2–3 minutes. Remove from heat.  
2. Boil sliced potatoes in salted water 8–10 minutes; drain.  
3. Heat oven to 180°C.  
4. In an ovenproof pan, layer half the potatoes; season. Top with onions, Gruyère, thyme, and half the cream. Repeat layers. Cover with foil; bake 30 minutes.  
5. Remove foil; place brie on the surface, cut-side down. Bake 30 minutes more until oozy and edges golden. Rest 5 minutes before serving.
