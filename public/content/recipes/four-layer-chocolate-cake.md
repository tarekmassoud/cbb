## Ingredients

### Cake
- 375 g all-purpose flour, sifted  
- 1/2 cup (50 g) cocoa powder  
- 2 1/2 tsp baking powder  
- 280 g caster sugar  
- 4 eggs  
- 375 ml milk  
- 250 g unsalted butter, melted  
- 200 g dark chocolate, melted  
- 2 tsp vanilla extract

### Ganache
- 220 g dark chocolate, chopped  
- 240 ml whipping cream  
- 1–2 Tbsp maple syrup (optional)

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 180°C. Line two 20 cm round tins with baking paper.  
2. In a bowl or mixer, whisk all cake ingredients until smooth.  
3. Divide into tins and bake 40–45 minutes or until a skewer comes out clean. Cool completely, then slice both cakes in half to get 4 layers.  
4. For ganache, heat chocolate, cream, and maple syrup in short bursts (microwave or bain-marie) and stir until smooth and glossy.  
5. Cover with plastic wrap touching the surface and cool to room temperature 3–4 hours until spreadable.  
6. Layer cakes with ganache and finish the top and sides.
