## Ingredients

- 1 cup tahini
- 1 cup coconut sugar
- 1/3 cup maple syrup
- 2 tsp vanilla extract
- 1 egg
- 2 cups wholemeal spelt flour
- 1 1/2 tsp bicarbonate of soda
- 1/4 tsp baking powder
- 200 g chopped dark chocolate
- 60 g white chocolate (optional)
- 1/3 cup cocoa powder

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 160°C. Grease two 22 cm round baking dishes or ovenproof frying pans.  
2. In a large bowl, combine tahini, coconut sugar, maple syrup, and egg; mix until smooth.  
3. In a separate bowl, whisk together spelt flour, bicarbonate of soda, baking powder, and cocoa powder.  
4. Add the dry ingredients to the tahini mixture and mix until just combined. Fold in the dark and white chocolate.  
5. Divide the cookie dough in two and press each half evenly into the prepared pans.  
6. Bake for about 15 minutes, or until the edges are set but the center is still soft and gooey.  
7. Serve warm, scooped straight from the pan.
