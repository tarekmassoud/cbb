## Ingredients

### For the Filling
- 400 g grilled fish leftovers, flaked
- 150 g frozen peas
- 150 g corn
- 2 tbsp fresh dill, chopped
- 2 tbsp chives, chopped
- Salt, to taste
- Black pepper, to taste
- Béchamel sauce (enough to coat the fish and vegetables)

### For Assembly
- 1 sheet puff pastry
- 1 egg yolk, beaten (for brushing)

## Instructions

1. Preheat your oven to 180°C.  
2. In a bowl, combine the béchamel with salt and black pepper to taste.  
3. Gently fold in the grilled fish leftovers, peas, corn, dill, and chives.  
4. Divide the mixture between individual ramekins.  
5. Roll out the puff pastry and cut circles large enough to cover each ramekin.  
6. Place a pastry circle on top of each ramekin and seal the edges. Cut a few small slits in the pastry to allow steam to escape.  
7. Brush the pastry with the beaten egg yolk.  
8. Bake in the preheated oven for about 25 minutes, or until the pastry is puffed and golden and the filling is hot.  
9. Allow the pot pies to cool for a few minutes before serving.
