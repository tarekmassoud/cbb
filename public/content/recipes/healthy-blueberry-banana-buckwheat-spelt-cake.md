## Ingredients

- 1½ cups or 390 g mashed banana (about 4 bananas)  
- ⅓ cup (40 g) oat bran  
- ¼ cup (60 ml) milk  
- ½ cup (125 ml) maple syrup, plus extra for brushing  
- 1 cup (250 ml) coconut oil, melted  
- 2 eggs  
- 1 tsp vanilla extract  
- 1 tsp ground cinnamon  
- 1 cup (160 g) buckwheat flour  
- 1 cup (130 g) white spelt flour  
- 3 tsp baking powder  
- 1 cup (150 g) blueberries  

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 160°C. Grease and line a 20×30 cm slice tin with non-stick baking paper.  
2. In a large bowl, combine the mashed banana, oat bran, milk, maple syrup, coconut oil, eggs, vanilla, and cinnamon. Mix well and allow to stand for 10–15 minutes.  
3. Sift in the buckwheat flour, spelt flour, and baking powder. Fold gently until just combined.  
4. Pour the batter into the prepared tin and scatter the blueberries evenly over the top.  
5. Bake for 45 minutes or until golden and a skewer inserted into the center comes out clean.  
6. While still warm, brush the top with a little extra maple syrup.  
7. Cool slightly, slice, and serve warm or at room temperature.
