## Ingredients
- 10 liters non-pasteurized goat or cow milk  
- 1/4 tsp rennet (majbané)

## Instructions

### 1. Heating the Milk
1. Pour the milk into a large pot.  
2. Heat gently to 38–40°C (100–104°F). Use a thermometer.

### 2. Adding Rennet
1. Sprinkle rennet over the milk.  
2. Mix well to ensure even distribution.  
3. Cover the pot and let it rest for one hour.

### 3. Cutting the Curd
1. After an hour, you should have a block of cheese (curd).  
2. Using a long knife, cut horizontally and vertically, then use a large spoon to cut it into cubes the size of normal ice cubes.  
3. Let it rest for 5 minutes.  
4. Gently shake the curds and repeat the shaking process every 5 minutes, five times in total.

### 4. Draining the Whey
1. Remove the curds from the whey and place them into a sieve.  
2. Transfer the curds into another sieve covered with a towel.  
3. Place a plate on top of the curds and add around 10–15 kg of weight.  
4. Let sit for 1 hour to press out remaining whey.

### 5. Boiling the Whey
1. While the curds are being pressed, boil the whey to extract ricotta.  
2. Cover and keep the whey warm.

### 6. Cooking the Cheese
1. Uncover, remove the pressed cheese, and cut into 12 equal slices.  
2. Slide the slices back into the warm whey kept at ~80°C and cook for 1 hour.  
   - If a slice pops up and floats, the milk was contaminated; discard it.  
3. After 1 hour, remove the slices from the whey.  
4. Squeeze and fold each slice.  
5. Place folded slices into a container, supporting each other.  
6. Sprinkle the cheese with 8 tsp kosher salt (for 12 cheeses).  
7. Cover with whey and let rest for 2 hours.

### 7. Storage
1. After 2 hours, remove the cheese from the whey water.  
2. Keep the halloumi in the fridge for up to 10 days.
