## Ingredients
- 1 kg full-fat plain yogurt  
- 1 tsp salt

## Instructions
1. Mix yogurt with salt. Line a fine mesh strainer with cheesecloth and set over a bowl.  
2. Pour salted yogurt into the strainer, gather cloth edges, and twist to form a pouch.  
3. Refrigerate to drain: 12–24 hours for soft spreadable labneh; up to 48+ hours for firmer labneh (for rolling into balls).  
4. Store in a covered container in the fridge for up to 2 weeks.
