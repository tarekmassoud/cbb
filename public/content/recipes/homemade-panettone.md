## Ingredients

- 190 ml whole milk  
- 2 × 7 g sachets fast-action dried yeast  
- 200 g strong white bread flour, plus extra for dusting  
- 200 g plain flour  
- 50 g caster sugar  
- 1/2 tsp fine sea salt  
- 3 eggs (2 for dough, 1 for brushing)  
- 1 tsp vanilla extract  
- 75 g butter, cubed and softened  
- 50 g sultanas  
- 2 tbsp brandy or orange juice  
- 75 g dark chocolate chips  
- 75 g candied peel, chopped  
- 3 tbsp flaked almonds  
- Icing sugar, for dusting  

## Instructions

1. Warm the milk until steaming, whisk in the yeast, and set aside for 5 minutes.
2. Place both flours, sugar, and salt in a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook.
3. Add the yeasted milk, eggs, and vanilla. Mix on medium speed for 10 minutes until smooth and elastic.
4. With the mixer running, add the butter cubes gradually until fully incorporated.
5. Transfer the dough to a clean bowl, cover, and prove for 1–2 hours until doubled.
6. Soak the sultanas in brandy or juice for a few hours.
7. Line a 20 cm loose-bottom tin with baking paper, allowing it to rise 4–5 cm above the rim.
8. Tip the dough onto a floured surface, flatten slightly, add the soaked fruit, chocolate, and peel, and knead gently.
9. Shape into a smooth round, place in the tin, cover, and prove for 3–4 hours until very puffy.
10. Preheat oven to 180°C. Brush with beaten egg, sprinkle with almonds, and bake for 1 hour until golden.
11. Cool completely in the tin, then dust with icing sugar before serving.
