## Ingredients

- 10 large eggs
- 2 tbsp mayonnaise
- 1 tsp Dijon mustard
- 1/2 tsp salt, divided
- 1/4 tsp freshly ground black pepper
- 2 tbsp finely chopped green onions or 1 tbsp green za'atar
- 1 ripe avocado, cut in thin slices
- 10–12 slices of pain de mie
- Optional: a thin layer of butter for each slice

## Instructions

1. Place the eggs in a pot, cover with cold water, and bring to a boil.
2. Once boiling, turn off the heat, cover, and let sit for 10 minutes.
3. Transfer to an ice bath, cool completely, then cut in half with a sharp knife.
4. Using a teaspoon, scoop the yolks into one bowl and the whites into another.
5. Chop the whites finely (not mashed) for a pleasant bite.
6. To the yolks add mayonnaise, mustard, and half of the salt.
7. Mash together with a fork or small whisk until smooth and creamy.
8. Gently fold in the chopped whites, pepper, and the remaining salt.
9. Stir in green za'atar or chopped green onions. Taste and adjust.
10. Optional: spread a thin layer of butter on the bread slices.
11. Spoon a generous layer of the egg mixture onto half the slices and top with avocado.
12. Add another spoon of egg mixture, close the sandwiches, press gently, and cut in half.
13. Enjoy right away, or wrap and chill for 30 minutes for a perfect café-style texture.
