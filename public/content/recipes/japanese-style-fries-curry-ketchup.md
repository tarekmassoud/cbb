## Ingredients

### For the Fries

- 450 g Lebanese potatoes, peeled and cut into chunks  
- 4–5 tbsp (40–50 g) potato starch or cornstarch  
- ½ tsp salt  
- ½ tsp chili flakes  
- ½ tsp garlic powder  
- ¼ tsp paprika  
- Oil for frying  

### For Serving

- Curry ketchup sauce (or your favorite curry ketchup)  

## Instructions

1. Place the peeled and cubed potatoes in a pot of generously salted cold water and bring to a boil.  
2. Cook until fork-tender, about 10–15 minutes, then drain well.  
3. Return the drained potatoes to the pot and stir over low heat for 1–2 minutes to remove excess moisture.  
4. Transfer the hot, dry potatoes to a large bowl and mash until completely smooth.  
5. Mix in the potato starch, salt, chili flakes, garlic powder, and paprika until a pliable dough forms.  
6. Place the dough onto a large sheet of parchment paper or inside a large zip-top bag.  
7. Cover with another sheet of parchment and use a rolling pin to flatten into an even rectangle about 1 cm thick.  
8. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours or freeze for 30–45 minutes until firm.  
9. Once chilled, remove the top layer of parchment or plastic and slice the dough into long strips about 1.5 cm wide.  
10. Heat 1–2 inches of oil in a deep pot to 190°C (375°F).  
11. Fry the potato strips in small batches until golden brown and crispy, about 3–5 minutes, turning gently for even frying.  
12. Transfer to a wire rack set over paper towels to drain excess oil.  
13. Serve immediately while hot and crispy with curry ketchup on the side.
