## Ingredients

### For the Kebbeh Quinoa Balls

- 1 ½ cups cooked quinoa, well-drained  
- 1 small onion, finely grated  
- 200 g lean lamb, finely minced  
- ½ tsp ground allspice  
- ½ tsp black pepper  
- 1 tsp salt  
- 2 tbsp olive oil (plus more for brushing or frying)  

### For the Keshk (Kishk)

- 8 tbsp keshk powder  
- 6 cups warm water  
- 1 tbsp olive oil or butter  
- 2 cloves garlic, crushed  

## Instructions

### Kebbeh Quinoa Balls

1. In a food processor, combine the grated onion, cooked quinoa, minced lamb, spices, and salt.  
2. Blend until the mixture comes together and is well combined.  
3. Shape the mixture into small balls or ovals (about the size of a golf ball).  
4. Arrange on a baking tray and brush with a little olive oil.  
5. Bake at 200°C for 15–20 minutes, turning once halfway through, until golden and cooked through.  

### Keshk

1. In a saucepan, heat the olive oil or butter over medium heat.  
2. Add the crushed garlic and sauté briefly until fragrant.  
3. Pour in the warm water, then gradually whisk in the keshk powder.  
4. Continue to cook over low heat, stirring constantly, until smooth and slightly thickened.  

### To Serve

1. Spoon the hot keshk sauce into shallow bowls or a serving dish.  
2. Add the baked quinoa kebbeh balls on top.  
3. Serve immediately, with extra keshk on the side if desired.
