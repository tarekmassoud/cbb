## Ingredients
- 1 kg (about 7 cups) all-purpose flour  
- 150 g (3/4 cup) sugar  
- 1 tbsp active dry yeast  
- 250 ml (1 cup) warm milk  
- 5 large eggs (reserve one for egg wash)  
- 150 g (2/3 cup) unsalted butter, melted  
- 2 tsp ground mahlepi (cherry seed spice)  
- 1 tsp ground mastika (mastic tree resin)  
- Zest of 1 orange  
- Pinch of salt  
- 1 egg, beaten  
- 1 tbsp water or milk

## Instructions
1. In a small bowl, dissolve yeast in warm milk with 1 tsp sugar. Let sit 10 minutes until frothy.  
2. In a large bowl, whisk together flour, sugar, mahlepi, mastika, orange zest, and salt. Make a well; add yeast mixture, eggs, and melted butter. Mix until a soft, slightly sticky dough forms.  
3. Knead about 10 minutes until smooth and elastic. Place in a greased bowl, cover, and let rise in a warm place 1–2 hours (or until doubled).  
4. Punch down; divide into three equal portions. Roll into long ropes, then braid. Transfer to a parchment-lined baking sheet, cover, and rise another hour.  
5. Heat oven to 180°C (350°F). Brush with egg wash (egg mixed with water or milk).  
6. Bake 25–35 minutes until golden brown. Cool on a wire rack before slicing.
