## Ingredients
**For the filling**
- 2 tbsp ghee or butter  
- 1/3 cup pine nuts (reserve half for garnish)  
- 1 onion, finely diced  
- 250 g beef mince  
- 1 tsp salt (or to taste)

**For the zucchini**
- 1 kg Lebanese zucchini (kousa), halved lengthwise  
- Olive oil, for brushing

**For the yogurt sauce**
- 500 g natural yogurt  
- 3 tbsp tahini  
- 2 cloves garlic, crushed  
- Juice of 1 lemon (or to taste)  
- 1 tsp salt  
- 1–2 tbsp water, as needed to thin

## Instructions
1. Toast pine nuts in ghee or butter until golden; remove half for garnish.  
2. In the same pan, sauté onion until soft. Add beef mince, cook until browned, and season with salt. Stir in half the toasted pine nuts; set aside.  
3. Trim ends and slice zucchini lengthwise. Stuff with meat mixture, pressing slightly.  
4. Whisk yogurt with cornstarch diluted in 1/4 cup water (if using), then whisk in yogurt, tahini, crushed garlic, lemon juice, and salt until smooth.  
5. Pour the labaniyeh into a large baking tray. Arrange stuffed zucchini in a single layer, filling side up—the sauce should come halfway up the sides.  
6. Preheat oven to 180°C (350°F). Bake 30 minutes. Uncover and bake another 10–15 minutes until sauce thickens slightly and the tops are lightly golden.  
7. Sprinkle with reserved pine nuts. Serve warm with rice or flatbread.
