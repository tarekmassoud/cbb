## Ingredients

- 2 L plain yogurt
- 3 tbsp cornstarch
- 1 egg
- 1 tsp tahini
- 1 tbsp salt
- 1 kg lamb shanks, plus two to three bones
- 1 onion, quartered
- 3–4 whole cloves
- 3–4 cardamom pods
- 1 cinnamon stick
- Bay leaves
- Hot water (for boiling)
- 20–25 small pearl onions
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 1/2 cup pine nuts
- 1 tbsp butter
- 1/2 cup finely chopped fresh parsley

## Instructions

1. Place the lamb shanks in a pressure cooker with onion, cloves, cardamom, cinnamon, bay leaves, salt, and enough hot water. Cook until tender; reserve broth.
2. Blanch the pearl onions, peel, and set aside.
3. In a pot, whisk yogurt, cornstarch, egg, and tahini until smooth. Cook over medium heat, whisking constantly, until it barely simmers.
4. Gradually add reserved broth to reach desired consistency. Add the cooked lamb and simmer gently.
5. Sauté the pearl onions in olive oil until lightly golden.
6. Toast pine nuts in butter until golden.
7. Top the stew with onions, pine nuts, and parsley. Serve hot.
