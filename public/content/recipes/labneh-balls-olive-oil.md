## Ingredients
- 1 kg full-fat plain yogurt  
- 1 tsp salt  
- Extra virgin olive oil (for preserving)

## Instructions
1. Mix yogurt with salt. Pour into a cheesecloth-lined colander over a bowl.  
2. Cover and refrigerate 3 days to drain; the labneh should turn thick and spreadable.  
3. Scoop equal portions and roll into smooth balls.  
4. Place in a sterilized jar and cover fully with olive oil.  
5. Seal and refrigerate. Keeps for several weeks.
