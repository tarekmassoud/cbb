## Ingredients
- 50 g butter
- 3 tbsp olive oil
- 600 g leeks, trimmed and very finely sliced
- 3 medium potatoes, peeled and chopped
- 1.5 litres vegetable or chicken stock
- 150 ml single cream
- Salt and black pepper

## Instructions
1. In a large pot, melt the butter with a splash of olive oil.
2. Add most of the sliced leeks, keeping a small handful aside. Cook gently over low heat for about 10 minutes until soft and sweet.
3. Add chopped potatoes, season with salt and pepper, then pour in the stock.
4. Bring to a gentle simmer and cook until the potatoes are fully tender.
5. Blend until smooth and velvety. Stir in the cream and adjust seasoning.
6. In a small pan, heat a little olive oil and fry the reserved leeks until crisp and lightly golden.
7. Serve hot topped with the crispy leeks.
