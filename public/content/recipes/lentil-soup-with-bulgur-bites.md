## Ingredients

### Soup
- 3 cups brown lentils, washed and drained  
- 6 garlic cloves, crushed  
- 1 medium onion, chopped  
- 1/2 cup lemon juice  
- 2 tsp salt  
- 2 tbsp olive oil

### Bulgur Wheat Bites
- 1 cup fine bulgur, washed and drained  
- 1 medium onion, finely chopped  
- 1 cup fresh mint leaves  
- 1 tsp freshly ground black pepper  
- 1/2 tsp ground allspice  
- 1/2 cup plain flour, sifted  
- 1/2 tsp salt

## Instructions

### Make the bites
1. In a food processor, mix together bulgur, onion, mint, pepper, allspice, flour, and salt. Gradually add about 1/4 cup water until you achieve a dough-like consistency.  
2. Form a half-teaspoon of dough into a little round bite. Repeat with the remaining mixture and set aside.

### Cook the soup
1. Turn on the heat to medium on the soup pot. Add 1 tbsp olive oil and the onion; cook until translucent.  
2. Add the lentils, cover with water, and cook uncovered for around 20 minutes or until cooked through.  
3. Carefully add the bulgur bites, cover, and cook over medium heat for a further 10 minutes.  
4. Stir in the garlic, lemon juice, and 1 tbsp olive oil. Cook for an additional 5 minutes. Taste and adjust seasoning.
