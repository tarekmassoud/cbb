## Ingredients

- 1 kg fresh Roman green beans  
- 6 medium tomatoes  
- 2 medium onions  
- 3–4 garlic heads, washed but unpeeled (plus a few extra if you love garlic)  
- 2 Tbsp olive oil (plus more to finish)  
- Sea salt flakes

## Instructions

1. Wash and trim tough ends from beans; halve if large.  
2. Peel and dice tomatoes. Peel and slice onions.  
3. In a large pan, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add onions and cook until translucent.  
4. Stir in green beans. Layer diced tomatoes over the top and add the garlic heads.  
5. Sprinkle with sea salt and drizzle with a little more olive oil.  
6. Cover and simmer on low 30–45 minutes, until beans are tender and flavors come together. Adjust salt and finish with a touch more olive oil.
