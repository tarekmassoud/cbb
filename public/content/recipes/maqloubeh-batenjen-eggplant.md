## Ingredients
- 4 large eggplants, sliced  
- 1 head of cauliflower, cut into florets  
- 8 large lamb cutlets (optional) or chicken pieces  
- 4 red or green chili peppers (optional)  
- 2 cups long-grain basmati rice, rinsed  
- 1/2 tsp turmeric  
- 1 tsp sweet paprika  
- 1 tsp black pepper  
- 2 tsp salt  
- 4 cups chicken, meat, or seasoned vegetable stock  
- Pinch of saffron  
- 1/4 cup pomegranate seeds  
- 1/3 cup roasted pine nuts

## Method
1. Cut eggplants into thick slices; sprinkle with salt and set aside 10 minutes. Pat dry.  
2. Season lamb or chicken with salt and spices. Roast at 210°C for about 10 minutes; set aside.  
3. Toss cauliflower florets with olive oil, season, and roast 10–15 minutes until tender.  
4. Shallow-fry eggplant slices until golden. Drain on paper towels.  
5. Rinse rice thoroughly and drain. Sprinkle with turmeric, paprika, black pepper, and salt.  
6. Heat stock; add saffron to infuse.  
7. In a deep pot, layer ingredients in this order: eggplants, meat (if using), roasted cauliflower, peppers, rice.  
8. Pour hot saffron stock over layers. Cover; cook on medium-low 30 minutes, or until rice is cooked and liquid absorbed.  
9. Let rest 10 minutes. Invert onto a large platter. Garnish with pine nuts and pomegranate seeds. Serve warm.
