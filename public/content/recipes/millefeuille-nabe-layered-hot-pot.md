## Ingredients

### For the pot
- 1 Napa cabbage  
- 6 baby bok choy  
- 300 g thinly sliced beef or pork belly (pastrami used in video)  
- 100 g enoki mushrooms

### Broth
- 1 liter dashi (or preferred broth)  
- 1 tbsp soy sauce  
- 1 tbsp mirin  
- 1 tbsp sugar

### Dipping sauce
- 3 tbsp soy sauce  
- 1 tbsp lemon juice  
- Zest of 1 lemon  
- 2 tbsp rice vinegar  
- 1 tsp toasted sesame seeds  
- 1 green onion, finely chopped  
- 1 tsp chili oil

## Preparation
1. Separate and rinse the Napa cabbage and bok choy leaves.  
2. Stack the ingredients in layers: one cabbage leaf, one bok choy leaf, and a slice of meat. Repeat until all ingredients are used.  
3. Cut the layered stack into equal sections and arrange them snugly in a pot. Place enoki mushrooms in the middle.  
4. In a separate bowl, mix broth, soy sauce, mirin, and sugar. Pour over the cabbage stacks and cook over medium heat until the cabbage and mushrooms are tender.  
5. Meanwhile, combine all dipping-sauce ingredients in a small bowl.  
6. Serve the hot pot with rice, accompanied by the dipping sauce. Garnish with chopped green onions.
