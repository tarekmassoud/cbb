## Ingredients

### Aubergines & Miso Sauce
- 9–10 baby aubergines, halved lengthwise
- 2 tbsp brown miso paste
- 2 tbsp sesame oil
- 2 tbsp hot water
- 4 tsp honey
- 2 tbsp tamari or soy sauce
- 2 tsp fresh ginger, grated
- 1 tsp crushed garlic
- 1 fresh chili, deseeded and finely chopped

### Coconut Rice
- 1 cup basmati rice
- 1 cup coconut milk
- 1 cup water
- Pinch of salt

### To Serve
- 2 handfuls baby spinach
- 2 cucumbers, cut lengthwise into batons
- 1 tbsp toasted sesame seeds
- 1 handful fresh coriander leaves
- 1 spring onion, finely sliced
- 1 grilled rack of lamb, sliced (optional)

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 200°C. Score the flesh of each aubergine in a cross-cross pattern.  
2. Arrange the aubergines cut side up on a baking tray.  
3. In a bowl, whisk together miso paste, sesame oil, hot water, honey, tamari (or soy), ginger, garlic, and chili until smooth.  
4. Brush the aubergines generously with the miso sauce.  
5. Roast for 20–25 minutes, or until the aubergines are tender and caramelized, brushing with extra sauce halfway through if desired.  
6. Meanwhile, rinse the rice, then place in a saucepan with coconut milk, water, and a pinch of salt. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, cover, and cook until the rice is tender and the liquid is absorbed. Fluff with a fork.  
7. To serve, divide the coconut rice between bowls. Add baby spinach, cucumber, roasted aubergines, sesame seeds, coriander, and spring onion.  
8. If using, slice the grilled lamb and arrange on top. Drizzle with any remaining miso sauce and serve warm.
