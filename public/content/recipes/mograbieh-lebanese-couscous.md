## Ingredients
- 500 g dried mograbieh (Lebanese couscous)  
- 2 bone-in lamb shanks  
- 6–8 chicken drumsticks  
- 300 g pearl onions (about 12 small)  
- 2–3 bay leaves  
- A bag of dried herbs (parsley, thyme, bay leaf)  
- 2 tbsp flour  
- 2 tbsp mograbieh spices  
- 150 g cooked chickpeas  
- 2 tbsp ghee or butter  
- Olive oil for browning  
- Salt & pepper

## Instructions
1. Rinse and pat dry lamb shanks. In a large pot, heat oil and brown shanks on all sides. Cover with water, bring to a boil, skim, and simmer; add garlic and bay.  
2. In another pan, melt 25 g butter and sauté pearl onions until golden; set aside.  
3. Add a drizzle of oil to the same pan; brown chicken drumsticks. Season and set aside.  
4. Add cinnamon stick and bay to the broth; simmer until lamb is tender.  
5. In a pot, melt clarified butter; gradually add mograbieh and toss to coat evenly.  
6. Ladle in hot broth; simmer gently, stirring. Add spices, chickpeas, and pearl onions.  
7. Return chicken and some lamb to the pot; simmer until couscous is tender.  
8. Adjust seasoning; serve hot with a pinch of mograbieh spice.
