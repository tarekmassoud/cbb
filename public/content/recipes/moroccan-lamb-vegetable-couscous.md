- 2 cinnamon sticks
- 5 tbsp ras hanout
- 3 tsp salt (or to taste)
- 2 tsp crushed garlic cloves
- 500 ml water (plus more if needed)

### For the Couscous

- 2 to 3 tbsp unsalted butter

### Vegetables and Add-ins

## Instructions
1. In a large pot, heat the vegetable oil. Add the lamb and brown it.
2. Add the onion and garlic and cook a few minutes until softened.
3. Add tomatoes, cinnamon sticks, ras hanout, salt, celery, and cilantro. Pour in the water.

9. Fluff with a fork, then add butter and rub/fluff again until light and separate.

### Finish and serve

11. Serve couscous topped with lamb and vegetables, with broth spooned over (or served on the side).
