## Ingredients
- 1 kg young green walnuts (picked before shells harden)  
- 800 g sugar  
- 1/2 tsp lemon acid  
- 1 cinnamon stick  
- 900 ml water

## Instructions
1. Wear gloves. Peel the green outer skin. Prick each walnut a few times with a skewer.  
2. Soak walnuts in water for 9 days, changing water twice daily to remove bitterness.  
3. In a pot, combine sugar and water; bring to a boil to form a syrup.  
4. Add walnuts and cinnamon stick; simmer 2–3 hours, until dark and tender.  
5. Stir in lemon acid during the last 15–20 minutes.  
6. Jar hot preserve in sterilized jars. Store in a cool, dark place. Traditionally served with shredded coconut or Arabic coffee.
