## Ingredients

- 200 g pappardelle or tagliatelle  
- 8–10 mushrooms, sliced (such as portobello)  
- 2 tbsp olive oil  
- 2 cloves garlic, crushed  
- ¼ cup fresh parsley, chopped  
- Salt and cracked black pepper, to taste  
- Grated Parmesan cheese, for serving (optional)  

## Instructions

1. Cook the pasta in salted boiling water according to package instructions until al dente. Reserve a little pasta water.  
2. While the pasta cooks, heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the garlic and cook for 1–2 minutes until fragrant.  
3. Add the sliced mushrooms and cook, stirring occasionally, until they are golden brown and tender, about 8–10 minutes.  
4. Add the cooked pasta and chopped parsley to the skillet and toss gently to combine. If the pasta seems dry, add a splash of reserved pasta water.  
5. Season with salt and cracked black pepper.  
6. Serve immediately, topped with extra parsley and grated Parmesan if desired.
