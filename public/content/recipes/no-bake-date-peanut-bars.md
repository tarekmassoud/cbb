## Ingredients
- 20 soft fresh dates (400 g), pitted  
- 3 tbsp (90 g) smooth peanut butter  
- 2 tsp vanilla extract  
- 1 cup (30 g) puffed rice  
- 1/4 cup (70 g) unsalted peanuts  
- 1 bar milk chocolate (for topping)

## Method
1. Line a 10×20 cm loaf tin with non-stick baking paper.  
2. Place the dates, vanilla, and peanut butter in a food processor; process until the mixture comes together into a paste.  
3. Transfer to a large bowl, add the puffed rice and peanuts; mix to combine.  
4. Press the mixture firmly into the base of the tin.  
5. Melt the chocolate in a heatproof bowl over barely simmering water; stir until smooth, then pour over the slice and spread evenly.  
6. Refrigerate 20–30 minutes until set. Remove, lift from the tin, and cut into bars. Store airtight in the fridge.
