## Ingredients

### Base
- 300g digestive biscuits  
- 150g unsalted butter, melted

### Cheesecake Filling
- 600g full-fat cream cheese  
- 60g icing sugar  
- 300ml double cream  
- 1 tsp vanilla extract  
- 100g mini chocolate eggs, crushed

### Decoration
- 100g whipped cream  
- 2 tbsp pistachio paste  
- 6 small Lindt chocolate bunnies

## Instructions
1. Blitz the digestives into fine crumbs. Mix with melted butter until well combined. Press firmly into the base of an 8-inch springform tin lined with non-stick baking paper. Chill while you prepare the filling.  
2. In a large bowl, beat the cream cheese with icing sugar and vanilla until smooth. Add the double cream and whisk until the mixture thickens and holds its shape.  
3. Gently fold in the crushed mini chocolate eggs. Spoon the filling onto the chilled base and smooth the top.  
4. Cover and refrigerate overnight to set.  
5. Whip the cream and mix in the pistachio paste until combined. Just before serving, pipe or spoon dots of pistachio cream on the cheesecake and place the chocolate bunnies for decoration.
