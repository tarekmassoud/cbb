## Ingredients

### Marinade
- 1 tbsp fennel seeds  
- 1 tbsp coriander seeds  
- 1/4 cup sugar  
- 1 tbsp kosher salt  
- Zest of 2 oranges  
- 3 sage leaves, finely chopped  
- 2 tbsp tarragon, finely chopped (optional)  
- 2 tsp Dijon mustard  
- 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil  

### Roast
- 1 whole chicken (1.8–2 kg), spatchcocked  
- Extra-virgin olive oil  
- Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper  
- 2 oranges, sliced  
- 2 fennel bulbs, sliced  
- 2 shallots, thinly sliced  
- 1 cup fresh orange juice  

## Instructions

1. Toast the fennel and coriander seeds in a dry pan until fragrant. Crush lightly.
2. In a bowl, mix crushed seeds with sugar, salt, orange zest, herbs, Dijon, and olive oil to form a paste.
3. Season the chicken with salt and pepper, then rub generously with the marinade. Let rest at room temperature for 30 minutes (or refrigerate overnight).
4. Preheat oven to 220°C.
5. Arrange fennel, oranges, and shallots in a roasting dish. Drizzle with olive oil and orange juice.
6. Place the chicken breast-side up on top of the vegetables.
7. Cover loosely with foil and roast for 20 minutes.
8. Uncover and continue roasting for another 25 minutes, basting occasionally, until deeply golden and cooked through.
9. Rest the chicken 10 minutes before serving.
10. Serve with the roasted fennel, oranges, and pan juices. Finish with fresh fennel fronds if desired.
