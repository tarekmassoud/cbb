## Ingredients
- 6 apples
- 4 eggs
- 125g flour
- 75g sugar
- 100 ml milk
- 50g butter + 10g for greasing the dish
- 6 tsp jam (cherry cinnamon jam, or any jam you like)
- 1 pinch of salt

## Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 200°C. Grease a baking dish with butter.
2. Peel the apples. Remove the core and seeds using an apple corer, keeping the apples whole.
3. Arrange the apples upright in the baking dish.
4. Separate the eggs. Beat the egg yolks with the sugar until pale and creamy.
5. Gradually add the milk. Add flour and salt and mix until combined.
6. In a clean bowl, beat the egg whites until stiff peaks form.
7. Gently fold the egg whites into the batter.
8. Pour the batter into the dish around the apples, being careful not to cover them.
9. Place a small piece of butter inside each apple, then finish with a spoonful of jam in the center.
10. Bake about 40 minutes, until golden and set. Cool slightly before serving.
