## Ingredients
- 4 cups store-bought caramel popcorn  
- 2 cups (440g) white sugar  
- 2/3 cup (160ml) light corn syrup or maple syrup  
- 1/3 cup (80ml) water  
- 1 tbsp bicarbonate of soda (baking soda)  

## Instructions
1. Spread caramel popcorn evenly in a large roasting tray lined with baking paper.  
2. In a medium saucepan, combine sugar, syrup, and water. Place over medium heat and stir until sugar dissolves. Bring to a boil and cook undisturbed 15–17 minutes, or until 140°C.  
3. Remove from heat and quickly whisk in baking soda until combined; the mixture will foam rapidly.  
4. Immediately pour foamy honeycomb over the popcorn, covering it evenly. Allow to cool and harden about 30 minutes.  
5. Break into shards. Serve or pack in bags for gifting.
