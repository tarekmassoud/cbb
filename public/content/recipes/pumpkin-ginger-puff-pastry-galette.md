## Ingredients

- 425 g pumpkin purée (from roasted butternut squash)
- 165 g brown sugar
- 1 tbsp unsalted butter, melted
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 1 tbsp ground cinnamon
- 1 1/2 tsp ground ginger
- 1/4 tsp freshly grated nutmeg
- 1/4 tsp sea salt
- 2 puff pastry sheets (ready-rolled)
- 3 large egg yolks
- Extra egg for egg wash, if desired

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 200°C.  
2. Cut a medium-sized butternut squash in half, scoop out the seeds, and place cut side down on a baking tray. Roast for about 40 minutes or until soft. Scoop out the flesh and mash or blend into a smooth purée.  
3. While the squash is still warm, stir in brown sugar, melted butter, vanilla, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, and sea salt. Allow to cool slightly.  
4. On a sheet of parchment, place one puff pastry sheet and lightly roll to smooth. Spread a generous layer of pumpkin filling over the center, leaving a 2 cm border all around.  
5. Fold the edges of the pastry up and over the filling, pleating as you go to form a rustic galette.  
6. Brush the exposed pastry with beaten egg yolk.  
7. Bake at 200°C for about 25 minutes.  
8. Reduce the oven temperature to 180°C and continue baking for another 15–20 minutes, or until the pastry is deeply golden and the filling is set.  
9. Let cool slightly before slicing and serving.
