## Ingredients
### Filling
- 600g fresh ricotta
- 250g cream cheese
- ¾ cup caster sugar
- 3 eggs
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- ¼ cup lime juice and finely grated lime rind

### Phyllo
- 8 sheets phyllo pastry
- 80g unsalted butter, melted
- Icing sugar, for dusting

## Instructions
- Preheat oven to 170°C. Grease a 23 cm springform and line the base.
- In a bowl, whisk ricotta, cream cheese, sugar, eggs, vanilla, lime juice and rind until smooth.
- Brush two phyllo sheets with butter and stack. Repeat to make a second stack. Crumple the remaining sheets lightly to create ruffled edges.
- Line the pan with stacked sheets, letting edges overhang. Pour in the filling, then tuck and ruffle the remaining phyllo around the top.
- Bake 40–45 minutes, or until just set and golden. Cool, then dust with icing sugar before serving.
