## Ingredients
- 2 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil  
- 1 large onion, chopped  
- 2 pounds ground lamb  
- 2 cups basmati rice  
- 2 tbsp salt  
- 1 tbsp seven spice  
- 1 tbsp ground cinnamon  
- 1 organic whole chicken (1 to 2 kg)  
- 1 cinnamon stick, 2 bay leaves, 1 celery stick, 1 carrot, 1 peeled onion  
- 1/4 cup pine nuts  
- 1/4 cup slivered almonds

## Instructions
1. Wash the chicken and pat dry.  
2. In a medium pot of boiling water, add the chicken, bay leaves, onion, and the cinnamon stick. Cover and boil for around 1½ hours, or until cooked through.  
3. In a large pot, heat the olive oil, add the chopped onion and cook for 5 minutes until soft.  
4. Add the ground meat and cook, stirring regularly, until the meat starts to brown.  
5. Add the rice, salt, seven spice, and ground cinnamon and cook for 2 minutes.  
6. Add 4 cups of chicken stock and bring to a boil, stirring occasionally. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 20–25 minutes until the rice is fully cooked.  
7. Set the oven to 200°C. Toast the nuts in the oven for 3–5 minutes until lightly golden.  
8. To assemble, place the rice mixture on a serving platter. Garnish with toasted nuts and serve with the chicken and lemon wedges.
