## Ingredients

### Soup
- 3 tbsp olive oil
- 1 medium squash, cubed
- 2 red bell peppers, seeded and chopped
- 1 onion, roughly chopped
- 4 cloves garlic
- 2 tbsp dried thyme
- 2 1/2 cups vegetable broth
- 1 cup canned coconut milk
- Sea salt and black pepper, to taste

### Croutons
- Pain de mie or any other French bread, cubed
- Olive oil
- Salt and black pepper, to taste
- Dried thyme

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 200°C.  
2. Spread the squash, bell peppers, onion, and garlic on a baking sheet lined with parchment. Drizzle with olive oil, sprinkle with thyme, salt, and pepper, and toss to coat. Roast for about 45 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender and lightly caramelized.  
3. Meanwhile, toss the bread cubes with a drizzle of olive oil, salt, pepper, and a pinch of dried thyme. Spread on a tray and bake for 10–15 minutes, or until golden and crisp. Set aside.  
4. Transfer the roasted vegetables to a large pot. Add vegetable broth and coconut milk. Bring to a simmer and blend with an immersion blender until smooth and creamy.  
5. Taste and adjust seasoning with more salt and pepper if needed.  
6. Ladle the soup into bowls and top with homemade croutons and a sprinkle of extra thyme. Serve warm.
