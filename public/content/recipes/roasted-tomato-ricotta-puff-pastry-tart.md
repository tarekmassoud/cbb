## Ingredients
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- About 3 cups baby tomatoes
- 1 tbsp brown sugar
- 1 tbsp balsamic vinegar
- Sea salt and cracked black pepper
- 1 sheet puff pastry
- 100g ricotta cheese
- Fresh baby basil leaves

## Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 180°C.
2. In an ovenproof pan, add the tomatoes. Drizzle with olive oil, balsamic vinegar, and sprinkle with brown sugar, salt, and pepper.
3. Cook on the stovetop for about 4 minutes, then remove from heat.
4. Cut a circle out of the puff pastry and lay it over the tomatoes, tucking the sides down so the tomatoes are covered.
5. Bake 25 minutes, or until puff pastry is puffed and golden.
6. Let cool slightly, then flip onto a serving plate.
7. Serve warm topped with crumbled ricotta and fresh basil leaves.
