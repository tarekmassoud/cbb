## Ingredients

- 2 cups or 240 g plain flour  
- ½ tsp salt  
- 1 tbsp baking powder  
- 85 g cold butter, cubed  
- 1 cup (about 113 g) pecorino or cheddar cheese, grated  
- 3 scallions (green onions), cleaned and chopped (white and green parts)  
- 2 large eggs  
- ⅓ cup milk  
- 1 tbsp Dijon mustard  

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 190°C. Lightly grease a baking sheet or line it with parchment paper.  
2. In a mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, salt, and baking powder.  
3. Rub in the cubed butter with your fingers until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.  
4. Add the grated cheese and chopped scallions and toss to combine.  
5. In a separate bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, and Dijon mustard.  
6. Pour the wet mixture into the dry ingredients and stir just until a soft dough forms (it will be a bit sticky).  
7. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and gently pat it into a circle about 2–3 cm thick.  
8. Cut the circle into triangles and arrange them on the prepared baking sheet.  
9. Bake for 20–23 minutes, or until the scones are golden brown.  
10. Cool slightly and serve warm.
