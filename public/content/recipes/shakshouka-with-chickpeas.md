## Ingredients

- 1–2 Tbsp olive oil  
- 1 large red onion, chopped  
- 1 tsp ground cumin  
- 1/2 tsp smoked sweet paprika  
- 1/2 tsp dried thyme or oregano  
- 1 chili pepper, deseeded and chopped  
- 2 1/2 cups tomatoes, halved  
- 1/2 cup tomato sauce  
- 1 Tbsp balsamic vinegar  
- 1 cup chickpeas, drained  
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste  
- 8 eggs

**To Serve**
- Fresh parsley, roughly torn  
- Sliced avocado  
- Fresh bread, for dipping

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 190°C.  
2. In a large ovenproof pan, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add onion, cumin, paprika, and thyme; cook ~8 minutes until the onion is soft and fragrant.  
3. Add chili, fresh tomatoes, tomato sauce, and balsamic vinegar. Stir and cook 8–10 minutes until tomatoes break down and sauce thickens slightly.  
4. Stir in chickpeas and remove from heat.  
5. Make small wells and crack the eggs in. Season with salt and pepper. Cover the pan with foil and bake ~10 minutes, until whites set but yolks remain soft. Uncover for the last few minutes if needed.  
6. Top with torn parsley, sliced avocado, and serve with fresh bread.
