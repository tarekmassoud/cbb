## Ingredients

### Mince
- Olive oil  
- 1 large onion, chopped  
- 200 g lamb or beef mince  
- Salt  
- 1/4 cup pine nuts  
- 4 tomatoes, chopped  
- 1 tbsp tomato paste  
- 1/2 cup boiling water

### Eggplants & Sauce
- ~10 small baby eggplants  
- Olive oil for frying or vegetable oil for deep frying  
- Tomatoes + tomato paste + water (for simmering sauce)

## Method
1. **Prepare the mince:** Sauté onion in olive oil; add mince and salt; cook 10–15 minutes. Toast pine nuts; fold into mince.  
2. **Make the sauce:** Simmer chopped tomatoes, tomato paste, and water 20 minutes; blend until smooth; season with salt.  
3. **Prepare eggplants:** Slit eggplants lengthwise 3/4 through; pat dry. Fry 10–15 minutes until tender; drain.  
4. **Assemble:** Spread sauce in baking pan. Scrape eggplants lightly with a fork; season. Stuff with mince. Pour sauce over, ensuring eggplants are 3/4 submerged.  
5. Cook on medium heat ~30 minutes until fully cooked. Serve topped with laban mtawam (tahini–garlic yogurt) and garnish with pomegranate seeds and toasted pine nuts.
