## Ingredients
- 3 small to medium potatoes, peeled and thinly sliced
- 1 large onion, thinly sliced
- Olive oil, for frying
- 6 large eggs
- Salt and black pepper

## Instructions
- Wash and peel the potatoes, then slice thinly. Pat dry with a clean towel.
- Peel and slice the onion into wedges. Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a medium frying pan over medium heat, add the onion and cook for 25–30 minutes until soft and lightly golden.
- Crack the eggs into a mixing bowl, season with salt and pepper, and whisk. Carefully add the warm potatoes and onions and stir to combine.
- Drizzle a non-stick pan with olive oil or butter. Pour in the mixture and cook over low heat for 20 minutes, or until almost set and there’s no runny egg on top.
- Loosen the sides of the tortilla. Flip onto a dinner plate, slide back into the pan, and cook another 5 minutes, or until golden on both sides.
- Serve hot or cold, with a simple green salad if you like.
