## Ingredients

### Cookie Dough
- 125g unsalted butter, softened
- 1/2 cup (90g) dark brown sugar
- 2/3 cup (250g) molasses
- 2 1/2 cups (375g) all-purpose flour
- 1 tsp bicarbonate of soda (baking soda)
- 2 tsp ground ginger
- 1 tsp mixed spice (cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves)

### Icing
- 2 cups (430g) icing sugar, sifted
- 1/4 cup (60ml) boiling water (plus more if needed)

## Instructions
1. Beat butter and brown sugar until pale and fluffy.
2. Add molasses and mix to combine.
3. Add flour, baking soda, and spices. Mix on low speed until dough forms.
4. Roll dough between two sheets of baking paper to about 3 mm. Refrigerate 30 minutes until firm.
5. Preheat oven to 160°C. Line trays with baking paper.
6. Cut out stars (4 to 5 cm). Re-roll scraps as needed.
7. Bake 7 to 10 minutes, or until just firm to the touch. Cool completely on a wire rack.
8. Whisk icing sugar with boiling water until smooth and pourable.
9. Dip each cooled cookie into the icing, let excess drip off, then set on a rack to dry.
