## Ingredients
- 1 ready-made shortcrust pastry (pâte brisée)
- 1 to 2 tbsp olive oil
- 1 medium onion, finely chopped
- 400 to 500g frozen spinach (no need to thaw fully)
- Sea salt and black pepper
- 6 eggs
- 1 cup (250ml) cooking cream
- 1 cup crumbled feta

## Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 180°C.
2. Line a tart/quiche dish with the shortcrust pastry.
3. Cover with parchment paper and add baking weights (or dry beans).
4. Blind bake 15 minutes (10 minutes covered, then 5 minutes uncovered). Remove and set aside.
5. In a pan, heat olive oil and sauté the onion until soft and translucent.
6. Add frozen spinach and cook until the water evaporates. Season with salt and pepper.
7. In a bowl, whisk eggs with cooking cream. Stir in feta, emmental, and mozzarella. Adjust seasoning.
8. Spread spinach over the pre-baked crust. Pour the egg mixture on top.
9. Bake 40 to 35 minutes (until golden, puffed, and set in the center).
10. Let rest 10 minutes before slicing. Serve warm or at room temperature.
