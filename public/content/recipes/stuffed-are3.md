## Ingredients

- 10–12 Lebanese courgettes (are3)  
- Sea salt and black pepper, to taste  
- 1 medium can tomato sauce (use about half to color the broth)  
- 1 1/2 cups water  
- 100 g basmati rice  
- 250 g minced lamb or beef  
- 2 large lemons, juiced  
- 6 cloves garlic, minced  
- 1 Tbsp dried mint  
- 1 Tbsp verjuice (optional, for serving)

## Method

1. Peel the courgettes and trim the ends. Using a vegetable corer, hollow carefully without piercing the bottoms.  
2. Rinse and briefly soak the hollowed courgettes in lemony water to prevent browning.  
3. Mix rice with minced meat; season with salt and pepper.  
4. Stuff each courgette, leaving a little room for rice to expand.  
5. Arrange vertically in a large pot with tomato slices (optional).  
6. Pour in enough tomato sauce to lightly color the broth (about half the can) and 1 1/2 cups water. Season with 1 tsp salt and 1/2 tsp black pepper.  
7. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer ~30 minutes until tender and rice is cooked.  
8. In the last 5 minutes, add garlic, dried mint, and lemon juice; simmer briefly.  
9. Serve warm with plenty of sauce and a spoonful of verjuice if desired.
