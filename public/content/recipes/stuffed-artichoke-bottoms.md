## Ingredients
- 1 pack frozen artichoke bottoms (supermarket freezer section)
- 1 medium onion, diced
- 200 g ground meat (beef or lamb)
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- 100 g pine nuts
- 1/4 cup lemon juice
- 2 tbsp flour

## Instructions
1. Sauté the onion in a skillet over medium heat until translucent.
2. Add the ground meat, season with salt and pepper, and cook about 10 minutes until browned.
