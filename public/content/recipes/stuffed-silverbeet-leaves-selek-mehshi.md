## Ingredients
- 3 bunches fresh silverbeet (chard)

### Filling
- 2 large onions, finely chopped  
- 1/2 cup dried split chickpeas, soaked and drained  
- 1 1/2 cup long-grain rice, washed and drained  
- 3 cups tomatoes, finely chopped  
- 1/2 cup chopped flat-leaf parsley  
- 1/3 cup chopped mint  
- 1/2 cup lemon juice  
- Salt and pepper  
- 2 to 3 tbsp sumac  
- 3/4 cup olive oil

## Instructions
1. Combine filling ingredients in a large bowl; mix well.  
2. Wash the silverbeet leaves; drop into a pot of hot water for a few seconds; drain and remove the stalks.  
3. Place a leaf on a board; put 1 tbsp filling in the center, fold sides, and roll tightly.  
4. Line a pot with a few leaves. Arrange stuffed rolls snugly; top with remaining leaves and stalks.  
5. Pour any leftover filling juices, plus 1/2 cup water, lemon juice, and olive oil over the rolls.  
6. Cook on medium heat until bubbling; then 20–25 minutes on low until rice is cooked through.  
7. Invert onto a serving plate; garnish with lemon wedges. Serve warm.
