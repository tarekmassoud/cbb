## Ingredients
- 8 bunches curly parsley  
- 1 bunch fresh mint leaves  
- 1 large onion  
- 8–10 medium tomatoes  
- Juice and zest of 2 lemons  
- 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil  
- 2 tbsp sumac  
- 2 tsp salt  
- 1 tsp ground black pepper

## Instructions
1. Wash and thoroughly dry parsley and mint (a salad spinner helps).  
2. Strip leaves and finely chop. Dice tomatoes and finely chop onion.  
3. In a bowl, add onion, salt, pepper, and sumac; gently squeeze to help the onion absorb the spices.  
4. Combine lemon juice and olive oil; toss through parsley, mint, and tomatoes.  
5. Add lemon zest, taste, and adjust seasoning. Serve chilled.
