## Ingredients

- 500 g white bread flour  
- 420 g warm water  
- 13 g dry yeast  
- 1 tsp honey  
- 1 tbsp olive oil (plus extra for greasing and topping)  
- 2 tsp sea salt  

### Topping

- About 10 small tomatoes  
- 10 cloves garlic  
- Olive oil, for confit and drizzling  
- Sea salt flakes  

## Instructions

1. In a large mixing bowl, combine the warm water with yeast, honey, and salt. Stir well.  
2. Add the flour and mix with a spoon until a sticky dough forms.  
3. Cover and let rest for 10 minutes, then stretch and fold the dough with a wet hand. Cover and rest again for another 10 minutes. Repeat the stretch-and-fold once more.  
4. Grease a bowl with olive oil, place the dough inside, rub the top lightly with oil, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for 24–48 hours.  
5. To make the garlic confit, place the tomatoes and garlic cloves in a small baking dish, cover generously with olive oil, and bake at 180°C for 20–25 minutes. Cool slightly.  
6. Grease a baking tray (about 22×33 cm) and gently turn the dough out onto it. Stretch and press it toward the edges. Let rest for 1–2 hours, until puffy.  
7. Preheat the oven to 220°C.  
8. Drizzle the dough with olive oil, then press your fingertips into the dough to create dimples.  
9. Arrange the confit tomatoes and garlic over the focaccia and drizzle with some of the infused oil. Sprinkle with sea salt flakes.  
10. Bake for 20–25 minutes, or until golden brown and cooked through.  
11. Cool slightly before slicing and serving.
