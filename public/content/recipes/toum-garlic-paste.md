## Ingredients
- 1 cup garlic cloves, peeled
- 2 cups vegetable oil
- 2 tbsp lemon juice
- 1 tsp salt (added at the end)

## Instructions
1. Peel and trim the garlic cloves.  
2. Place garlic in a food processor and pulse until finely minced, scraping down the sides.  
3. With the processor running, slowly drizzle in the oil in a thin stream. Start with about 1/4 cup at first.  
4. Alternate between adding oil and lemon juice **very slowly**—this helps create a smooth, fluffy emulsion.  
5. When the mixture turns thick and creamy, add the salt.  
6. Blend briefly to incorporate. Store chilled.
