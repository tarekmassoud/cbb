## Ingredients
- 18 soft fresh dates, pitted and halved  
- 1/4 cup (60 ml) hot espresso coffee  
- 1/2 cup (80 ml) boiling water  
- 1/4 cup (55 g) brown sugar  
- 1 tsp vanilla extract  
- 1¼ cups (200 g) wholemeal self-raising flour (or flour + 2 tsp baking powder)  
- 1/2 cup (60 g) almond meal  
- 2 eggs  
- 1/2 cup (125 ml) milk  
- 1/3 cup (80 ml) grapeseed or vegetable oil  
- 1 tbsp maple syrup  
- 1/3 cup (55 g) extra brown sugar

## Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 160°C and line a 20 cm round cake tin with non-stick baking paper.  
2. Arrange the halved dates, cut-side down, evenly across the base of the tin.  
3. In a medium jug, combine hot espresso, boiling water, brown sugar, and vanilla; stir to dissolve. Pour evenly over the dates.  
4. In a large bowl, whisk together flour, almond meal, eggs, milk, oil, maple syrup, and the extra brown sugar until combined.  
5. Pour the batter evenly over the dates. Bake for 40–45 minutes, or until a skewer comes out clean.  
6. Let the cake cool in the tin for 30 minutes. Invert onto a plate and remove the tin and paper. Slice and enjoy.
