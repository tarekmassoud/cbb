## Ingredients

- 8 cups cream  
- 2 vanilla beans, split and seeds scraped  
- 12 egg yolks  
- 250 g fresh raspberries  
- 140 g caster sugar, plus 6 tbsp extra for sprinkling  

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 150°C.  
2. Place the cream, vanilla beans, and vanilla seeds in a saucepan over medium heat.  
3. Heat until just below boiling point, then remove from the heat and set aside.  
4. In a large bowl, whisk the egg yolks and caster sugar together until smooth and slightly pale.  
5. Remove the vanilla beans from the cream and discard them.  
6. Gradually whisk the warm cream into the egg yolk mixture until smooth.  
7. Arrange the raspberries in a baking dish or individual ramekins.  
8. Pour the custard mixture gently over the raspberries.  
9. Place the baking dish or ramekins inside a larger roasting pan.  
10. Pour boiling water into the roasting pan until it reaches halfway up the sides of the baking dish or ramekins.  
11. Bake for 25–30 minutes, or until the custard is just set but still slightly wobbly in the center.  
12. Carefully remove from the water bath and cool to room temperature.  
13. Refrigerate for 4–6 hours, or until completely chilled and set.  
14. Just before serving, sprinkle the surface evenly with the extra sugar.  
15. Use a kitchen blowtorch to caramelize the sugar until golden and crisp.  
16. Serve immediately.
