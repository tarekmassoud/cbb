## Ingredients
- Mixed root peelings and thin veg slices (potatoes, parsnips, carrots, radishes)  
- 3 tbsp olive oil

### Curry Salt
- 1/2 tsp sea salt flakes  
- 1/2 tsp turmeric  
- 1/2 tsp ground cumin  
- 1/2 tsp ground coriander  
- 1/8 tsp mild chili powder  
- 1/4 tsp caster sugar

## Instructions
1. Heat oven to 190°C (170°C fan). Mix curry-salt ingredients.  
2. Tip veg peelings into a bowl; toss with olive oil and two-thirds of the curry salt.  
3. Divide between two non-stick trays; bake 20–25 minutes, tossing halfway, until really crisp.  
4. Return to the bowl; sprinkle over remaining curry salt. Serve immediately.
