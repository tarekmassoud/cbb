## Ingredients
- 2 tbsp vegetable oil  
- 1 cup cooked chickpeas, drained and patted dry  
- 250 g mushrooms, sliced  
- 1 large onion, finely chopped  
- 5 garlic cloves, minced  
- 2 tsp ginger, grated  
- 6 cups water or light vegetable stock  
- 2–3 tbsp white or yellow miso paste, to taste  
- 1–2 tbsp soy sauce  
- 200 g dried ramen or egg-free noodles  
- 1 small head broccolini or broccoli, halved lengthwise  
- Rice vinegar, to taste  
- Sea salt and cracked black pepper  
- Cilantro leaves and chili oil, for serving

## Instructions
1. Heat 1 tbsp oil in a wide pot over medium-high. Add chickpeas and cook, stirring, until crisp and golden, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a bowl; season with salt.  
2. In the same pot, add remaining oil, onion, ginger, and garlic. Cook until soft and fragrant. Stir in mushrooms; cook 3–4 minutes until lightly browned.  
3. Pour in water or stock. Whisk in miso and soy. Bring to a gentle boil, reduce heat, and simmer 15–20 minutes.  
4. Meanwhile, cook noodles in salted boiling water to al dente. Drain and rinse.  
5. Add broccolini to the broth and simmer 2 minutes until bright and tender. Adjust seasoning with vinegar, salt, and pepper.  
6. Divide noodles between bowls. Ladle over hot broth and veggies. Top with crispy chickpeas, cilantro, and a drizzle of chili oil.
