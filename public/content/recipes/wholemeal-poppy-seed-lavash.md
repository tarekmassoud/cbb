## Ingredients
- 1 tsp dried yeast
- 2/3 cup (160ml) lukewarm water
- 1 tsp honey
- 1 1/2 cups (240g) wholemeal plain flour
- 2 tbsp poppy seeds
- 1 tsp sea salt flakes (plus extra to sprinkle)
- 1/4 cup (60ml) extra-virgin olive oil (plus extra for brushing)

## Instructions
1. In a small bowl, mix yeast, lukewarm water, and honey. Set aside 5 to 10 minutes until foamy.
2. In a large bowl, mix flour, poppy seeds, and salt. Make a well in the center.
3. Add yeast mixture and olive oil. Mix, then knead 5 to 6 minutes until smooth and elastic.
4. Place dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover, and rest 20 minutes.
5. Preheat oven to 180°C. Line baking trays with baking paper.
6. Roll dough very thin (about 1 mm). Cut into small rounds (or any shapes you like).
7. Place on trays, brush with olive oil, and sprinkle with poppy seeds and a little salt.
8. Bake 10 to 12 minutes until crisp and lightly golden. Cool on a rack.
