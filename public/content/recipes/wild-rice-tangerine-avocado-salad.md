## Ingredients

- 2 cups wild rice or quinoa  
- 3 tangerines, divided  
- 2 avocados, halved and pitted (one for dressing, one for salad)  
- 1 cup chopped walnuts  
- ½ cup sliced dates  
- 1 small shallot, peeled and quartered  
- ½ cup extra-virgin olive oil  
- 3 tbsp red wine vinegar  
- 2 tsp Dijon mustard  
- 2 tsp honey  
- 1¼ tsp salt  

## Instructions

1. Place the rice in a large saucepan and cover generously with water. Bring to a simmer over high heat, then reduce to medium-low and cook until just tender but not mushy. Drain and cool slightly.  
2. Zest and juice one tangerine. Segment the remaining two tangerines and set aside.  
3. In a blender, combine the tangerine zest and juice, ¼ avocado, shallot, olive oil, red wine vinegar, Dijon, honey, and salt. Blend until smooth to make the dressing.  
4. In a large bowl, combine the cooked rice, remaining avocado (diced), walnuts, dates, and tangerine segments.  
5. Drizzle with the dressing and toss gently to coat. Serve at room temperature or slightly chilled.
